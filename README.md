# ```SLR-simple-linear-regression ```
Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (also called the response variable) and an independent variable (also called the predictor variable). The goal of simple linear regression is to find a linear equation that best describes the relationship between these variables.

# ```correlation :```
In statistics, correlation refers to the degree to which two variables are related to each other. A correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

There are several types of correlation coefficients, but the most commonly used is the Pearson correlation coefficient, also known as Pearson's r. Pearson's r ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (i.e., as one variable increases, the other decreases), 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (i.e., as one variable increases, the other increases), and 0 indicates no linear correlation between the two variables.

# ```Square root transformation:```
Square root transformation is a type of data transformation that can be used to normalize data that have a right-skewed distribution.
It involves taking the square root of each observation in the data. This has the effect of reducing the influence of extreme values in the data, while preserving the order of the data.

The square root transformation can be useful in situations where the variance of the data increases with the mean, which is common in count data or other non-negative data. By taking the square root of each observation, the variance is reduced, and the data may become more suitable for analysis using methods that assume normality.

# ```Cube root transformation:```
Cube root transformation is a type of data transformation that can be used to normalize data that have a highly skewed distribution with positive values. It involves taking the cube root of each observation in the data. This transformation is a little bit more aggressive than the square root transformation.

The cube root transformation can be useful in situations where the variance of the data increases with the mean, which is common in count data or other non-negative data. By taking the cube root of each observation, the variance is reduced, and the data may become more suitable for analysis using methods that assume normality.

# ``` Log transformation:```
Log transformation is a type of data transformation that can be used to normalize data that have a right-skewed distribution. It involves taking the logarithm of each observation in the data. This has the effect of compressing the range of the data and reducing the influence of extreme values, while preserving the order of the data.

The log transformation is commonly used with data that have a multiplicative relationship, such as financial data or scientific data with exponential growth. In these cases, taking the logarithm of the data can make the relationship between variables more linear and easier to model with statistical methods.

# ```Homoscedastic and Heteroscedasticity:```
In statistics, a sequence (or a vector) of random variables is homoscedastic. if all its random variables have the same finite variance; this is also known as homogeneity of variance. The complementary notion is called heteroscedasticity, also known as heterogeneity of variance.
